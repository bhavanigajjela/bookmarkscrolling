                    Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.
                    Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.”
                    Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.Goals are about the results you want to achieve.Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed what James calls, the “Plateau of Latent Potential.”</p>

                <p>
<strong>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:</strong> <br>
(1) we try to change the wrong thing and <br>
(2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.
<br><strong>There are three layers of behavior change:</strong><br>
 a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
 <br>
 Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.
 It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
 Ask yourself,Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?
 The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
 Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
 Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
 The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p>

            <p>Whenever you want to change your behavior, ask yourself:

                How can I make it obvious?<br>
                How can I make it attractive?<br>
                How can I make it easy?<br>
                How can I make it satisfying?<br>
                “A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
                The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
                Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward."
            <br>
                “The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.”</p>

                <p>“If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: ‘Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?’               
With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
                    once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
                    
                    The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
                    
                    Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
                    
                    The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior."</p>
